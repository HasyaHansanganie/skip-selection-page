  - Sidebar displays navigation links  
  - Navigation buttons show current progress  
  - Future page icons are set to be disabled but remain clickable for testing (commented logic included)

  A fast-access panel that allows users to jump to a specific skip size, which:
  - Highlights the relevant skip card  
  - Automatically triggers the selection behavior
